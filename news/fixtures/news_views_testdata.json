Scientists are still trying to work out how someone so incredibly talented can be so utterly lovely.\"\r\n\r\nThe second series of Fleabag aired on the BBC earlier this year and has been released by Amazon in the US.\r\nOther British winners include Ben Whishaw, who won best supporting actor in a limited series for his role in BBC One's A Very English Scandal. He played Norman Scott, the man who accused Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe of trying to have him killed.\r\n\r\nCharlie Brooker won best television movie for Netflix's Bandersnatch, a win he said he was \"quite unprepared for\". The interactive Bandersnatch allowed viewers to choose the way the film's storyline unfolded.\r\n\r\nIn his speech, Brooker thanked his two children, joking: \"I can never limit your video game screen time again, if I do I'm a disgusting hypocrite [because] it sometimes pays off.\"\r\n\r\nBritish writer Jesse Armstrong, whose work on HBO's Succession won him best writing for a drama series, made reference to the strong UK showing at the ceremony.\r\n\r\n\"Quite a lot of British winners, maybe too many? Maybe you should have a think about those immigration restrictions,\" he joked.",

        "article_text": "A commonly-prescribed antidepressant reduces anxiety first and has a smaller effect on depressive symptoms weeks later, a study suggests.\r\n\r\nResearchers at University College London said it made people feel better but worked in unexpected ways.\r\n\r\nTheir trial involved 653 UK patients, half of whom were given sertraline and the other half a placebo (dummy pill).\r\n\r\nPsychiatrists say the findings are reassuring for doctors and patients, confirming the benefits of treatment.\r\n\r\nAntidepressants are one of the most commonly-prescribed medications in the UK and concerns have often been raised that too many are being given to patients.\r\n\r\nSertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is one of the most common drugs used to treat symptoms of depression and anxiety.\r\n\r\nBut scientists still have little idea of how these kind of drugs work.\r\nQuick improvements\r\n\r\nIn this study, published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal, patients with mild to severe depressive symptoms, or anxiety, or a mix of both, were selected from 179 GP surgeries in the UK and enrolled on the trial.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, GPs were not sure whether to prescribe an antidepressant.\r\n\r\nAfter six weeks, the patients taking sertraline reported a 21% greater improvement in anxiety symptoms - such as feeling worried, nervous and irritable - compared to the control group taking a dummy pill. After 12 weeks, the gap was 23%.\r\n\r\nBut there was little evidence of the drug reducing depressive symptoms, such as poor concentration, low mood and lack of enjoyment after six weeks - and only marginal improvements (13%) after 12 weeks.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the group taking antidepressants were twice as likely as the other trial participants to say their mental health felt better overall.\r\nBut she added: \"It also shows that antidepressants are not the solution for everyone and reinforces the importance of combining them with other options, such as talking therapies and social prescribing.\"\r\n\r\nProf Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said antidepressants worked best \"when taken for significant periods of time, which is one reason why doctors will often review patients after several weeks of use and then prescribe a fairly long course of the drugs, if they appear to be beneficial\".\r\n\r\n\"This study gives an interesting insight into how a medication primarily used to treat depression may be improving a patients' health in other ways in the shorter term, by reducing symptoms of anxiety, which is often associated with depression.\"\r\n\r\nPrevious research found that all antidepressants were more effective at reducing symptoms of acute depression than dummy pills, but it was not based on patients' individual views of how they felt.\r\n\r\nThe trial is the largest placebo-controlled trial of an antidepressant which has not been funded by the pharmaceutical industry, the UCL researchers said.",

        "is_published": true,
        "article_text": "Sebastian Vettel finally achieved the victory he has needed for some time at the Singapore Grand Prix - but it came about with a healthy dose of luck and a big chunk of controversy.\r\n\r\nThe Ferrari driver's last win was in the Belgian Grand Prix on 26 September 2018; and since then his driving has been more notable for its regular errors than the speed and easy elegance that marked his four world titles with Red Bull.\r\n\r\nVettel's position as Ferrari number one has been threatened - if not already usurped - by his 21-year-old team-mate Charles Leclerc, and the German has faced questions about his future in the sport.\r\n\r\nComing to Singapore, where he has had such success in the past, offered a chance for redemption and catharsis. He got it, but not perhaps in the way he would have wanted.\r\n'I'm not happy when I'm not delivering'\r\n\r\nVettel was asked after the race whether the win was a relief.\r\n\r\n\"Yes in a way,\" he said. \"Maybe it kicks in a bit later but yeah, maybe just a confirmation that if you keep doing what you do\u2026\r\n\r\n\"[There are] moments where you know that things are wrong and you need to make changes but lately I didn't feel that any big changes are necessary. In that regard, it's a confirmation but it's not like 'finally I can breathe again'. It's not like I felt in a wrong and bad place. I knew that I have to pull through and go through it myself.\"\r\n\r\nAs for answering his critics, he said: \"Maybe less satisfying than you think. It wasn't like we were lacking speed or anything. Recently, I think there was nothing wrong in general. Things weren't maybe falling in place, plus obviously I messed up in the race in Monza, that's my mistake.\r\n\r\n\"I've been around now for a long, long time and yeah, it's just how the tide turns sometimes. I have the highest expectation on myself and I'm not happy when I'm not delivering what I know I can.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I had moments this year when I was struggling to just get it out. So, I know that I can improve from there, and I can't be happy with that. But equally I know that it wasn't as bad or disastrous as maybe then people put it together.\"\r\nDid the right Ferrari win?\r\n\r\nIt remains to be seen whether this victory will do anything to stem the tide Vettel is facing in the challenge of Leclerc at Ferrari, for while he drove well to seize victory when the chance to do so was provided to him, in many ways the 'wrong' Ferrari won at Marina Bay on Sunday.\r\n\r\nIt was Leclerc who took a brilliant pole, with an extrovert and acrobatic lap in which he danced with disaster against the walls to snatch top spot from Vettel, who was ahead after the first runs in final qualifying and who also fell behind Lewis Hamilton.\r\n\r\nAnd it was Leclerc who led from the start and who should have been able to control the race on a track on which overtaking is close to impossible among closely matched cars.\r\n\r\nBut Ferrari admitted to catching themselves out with what is known as the 'undercut', when a car stopping first benefits from the pace provided by fresh tyres to gain a place.\r\n\r\nFerrari's idea in pitting Vettel was to hopefully get him ahead of Hamilton - and at the same time to ensure the German could emerge in clear air in a gap ahead of Nico Hulkenberg's Renault, which was going quickly on fresh tyres after an early incident, and behind Lance Stroll's Racing Point.\r\n\r\nThey stopped Leclerc a lap later, expecting him to emerge still in the lead, only to see Vettel in front.\r\n\r\n\"The undercut was effectively more powerful than expected,\" said team boss Mattia Binotto. \"We were not expecting such a big number. We thought Charles stopping the lap after would come out ahead of Sebastian.\"\r\n\r\nThe 'undercut' bought Vettel 3.5 seconds when normally it would be more like one to two.\r\n\r\nIn the car, Leclerc was furious, repeatedly asking what had happened and expressing his disbelief. And even as he calmed down after the race, he was still making it clear that he was not happy about it and wanted a full explanation.\r\n\r\nFerrari's strategy was successful, in that it turned a one-three into a one-two. But the controversy here is that it is convention in F1 for the lead car in a team to be given the strategy advantage. As Leclerc put it: \"You never undercut one car with the other in the same team; this never happens.\"\r\n\r\nBinotto admitted later that they had considered swapping the two cars back - although those conversations were not shared with the drivers.\r\n\r\n\"I understand Charles is disappointed,\" he said. \"He did his best to win the race and he could have won the race. We did consider to swap. We are still discussing with the drivers whether it was the right choice or not.\"\r\n\r\nThose discussions will, he made it clear, continue into this week, and it remains to be seen how it affects the obvious and unavoidable tension between the drivers - the proud, ageing champion and the man who looks on the evidence of this season to be emerging as simply quicker.\r\n\r\nLeclerc's pole was the ninth time in a row that he has out-qualified Vettel, and to do it on a track on which Vettel has so often excelled in the past will have hurt.\r\n\r\nIn all that context, then, victory tasted sweet for Vettel. He pushed as hard as he could on his out lap, and then picked his way through the slower cars in front of him extremely well - and better than Leclerc - as he sought to consolidate his position.\r\n\r\nBut he will know that it was to a large degree handed to him - albeit accidentally - even if he was not exactly keen to discuss it afterwards.\r\n\r\nHow would he feel if the positions were reversed, he was asked?\r\n\r\n\"Not that much point giving that much thought because it wasn't that way,\" Vettel said. \"The team is bigger than myself, bigger than any individual, and we finished one-two. For me and Charles the order is important. That is why we are here, to fight for victories. But for the team the order is not important.\"\r\n\r\nAt another point, he said: \"You are very misled if you ever think you are bigger than this team.\" Was that a remark directed at Leclerc?\r\n\r\nA couple of hours after the race, Leclerc had calmed down and was playing the team game.\r\n\r\n\"In the car it was very frustrating,\" he said. \"Now I understand a lot more the situation. I am extremely happy for the team and extremely happy for Seb, too. He deserves it. I wish I was one step higher but it is part of life. Sometimes it goes that way and I will bounce back stronger in Russia.\"",

        "article_text": "Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump asked his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to put a hold on millions in military aid to Ukraine roughly one week before a call with the Ukrainian president in which he pressured the country to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, two senior administration officials said on Monday.\r\nTrump was primarily concerned with \"corruption\" in Ukraine and Europe shouldering more of the financial burden for supporting Ukraine's defense, according to one of the officials.\r\nThere is no evidence of wrongdoing by either Joe or Hunter Biden.\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post was first to report that Trump told Mulvaney to put a hold on almost $400 million in military aid for Ukraine.\r\nCiting three senior administration officials with knowledge of the internal deliberations, the Post said officials at the Office of Management and Budget passed along Trump's request to the Pentagon and the State Department at an interagency meeting in mid-July.\r\nAccording to the paper, administration officials were told to tell lawmakers that the delay in aid was the result of an \"interagency process\" without giving more information.\r\nNews of Trump's order to withhold aid to the Ukraine ahead of his July 25 call may trigger questions -- and speculation -- about the President's motive in doing so.\r\nOn Friday, CNN reported Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the call to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden's son, Hunter, according to a person familiar with the situation. That call was part of the whistleblower complaint submitted to the Intelligence Community Inspector General, another person familiar with the situation told CNN.\r\nTrump on Sunday said that he did indeed discuss Biden with Ukraine's president -- at a time when the country was awaiting the aid package from the United States -- but he denied doing anything improper.\r\n\r\nThe growing controversy has brought House Democrats near a \"tipping point\" on impeachment as the party weighs how to respond to the incident. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who sharpened her rhetoric over the weekend, is still not committing to moving forward with impeachment proceedings -- though she is keeping the door open.\r\nThis story has been updated with CNN reporting from two senior administration officials.",

They then have a range of considerations to weigh up to decide whether they are compelled to comply or not.\r\n\r\nGoogle had argued that the obligation could be abused by authoritarian governments trying to cover up human rights abuses were it to be applied outside of Europe.\r\n\r\n\"Since 2014, we've worked hard to implement the right to be forgotten in Europe, and to strike a sensible balance between people's rights of access to information and privacy,\" the firm said in a statement following the ECJ ruling.\r\n\r\n\"It's good to see that the court agreed with our arguments.\"\r\n\r\nThe tech firm had been supported by Microsoft, Wikipedia's owner the Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and the UK freedom of expression campaign group Article 19, among others.\r\n\r\nECJ adviser Maciej Szpunar had also concluded that the right to be forgotten be limited to Europe in a non-binding recommendation to the court earlier this year.\r\n\r\n    Google fights plan to extend 'right to be forgotten'\r\n    Google backed on limiting search results over right to be forgotten\r\n    The secrets of controlling your internet profile\r\n\r\nThere has been a lot of interest in the case since, had the ruling gone the other way, it could have been viewed as an attempt by Europe to police a US tech giant beyond the EU's borders.\r\n\r\nThose wanting to read the full ruling were frustrated in the hour following its release because the ECJ's own website crashed.\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nGeoblocked results\r\n\r\nGoogle has applied the right to be forgotten since May 2014, when the ECJ first determined that under some circumstances European citizens could force search firms to delist webpages containing sensitive information about them from queries made using their names.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to hide sensitive information - such the fact a person once committed a criminal offence or had an extra-marital affair - if the details are judged to be \"inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant or excessive\".\r\n\r\nGoogle has said that since that time it has received more than 845,000 requests to remove a total of 3.3 million web addresses, with about 45% of the links ultimately getting delisted.\r\n\r\nThis involves both removing the results from its European sites - such as Google.fr, Google.co.uk and Google.de - as well as restricting results from its other sites - such as Google.com - if it detects a search is being carried out from within Europe.\r\n\r\nHowever, this means that users can still circumvent the action if they use a virtual private network (VPN) or other tool to mask their location.\r\n\r\nNotably, the ECJ ruling said that delistings must \"be accompanied by measures which effectively prevent or, at the very least, seriously discourage an internet user\" from being able to access the results from one of Google's non-EU sites.\r\n\r\n\"It will be for the national court to ascertain whether the measures put in place by Google Inc meet those requirements.\"\r\n\r\nNews sites, including the BBC, are exempt from the rule, but may find that links to some of their old articles no longer appear on Google or other search engines.\r\n\r\nThe right to be forgotten should still apply to the UK if it leaves the EU, with or without a deal, at least in the short to medium-term.\r\n\r\n\"How it's applied might diverge over time, as UK courts no longer follow ECJ decisions and the Supreme Court in the UK wrestles with these points instead,\" a spokesman for Linklaters told the BBC.\r\n\r\n\"But day one, we're going to have a UK version of the GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation], including a right to be forgotten.\"",

        "description": "<p>Families of those killed while watching a Batman film in 2012 have written to Warner Bros with concerns about the new Joker film and urging the studio to join action against gun violence.</p>",
        "is_published": true,
        "article_text": "<p>Twelve people died in a cinema showing The Dark Knight Rises in Colorado. They included Jessica Ghawi, 24, whose mother Sandy Phillips told BBC News she was \"horrified\" by the Joker trailers. Warner Bros said the film - which stars Joaquin Phoenix - was not an endorsement of real-world violence. Phoenix walked out of a recent interview when asked about the issue. Sandy Phillips and her husband, Lonnie, who run Survivors Empowered, an anti-gun violence group, wrote to Warner Bros along with three others whose relatives were killed, injured or caught up in the 2012 shooting. Speaking to BBC News, Mrs Phillips said: \"When I first saw the trailers of the movie, I was absolutely horrified. \"And then when I dug a little deeper and found out that it had such unnecessary violence in the movie, it just chilled me to my bones. \"It just makes me angry that a major motion picture company isn't taking responsibility and doesn't have the concern of the public at all.\" 'Daring' or 'garbage'? Joker film divides critics Joker and Roman Polanski win at Venice festival The families' letter said: \"When we learned that Warner Bros was releasing a movie called Joker that presents the character as a protagonist with a sympathetic origin story, it gave us pause. \"We support your right to free speech and free expression. But as anyone who has ever seen a comic book movie can tell you: with great power comes great responsibility. That's why we're calling on you to use your massive platform and influence to join us in our fight to build safer communities with fewer guns.\" The letter asked the studio to lobby for gun reform, help fund survivor funds and gun violence intervention schemes, and end political contributions to candidates who take money from the National Rifle Association. In its response, the studio said it has \"a long history of donating to victims of violence\", including the 2012 cinema shooting in Aurora, Colorado. It added: \"Make no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\" Joker, which is released in the US on 4 October, has received rave reviews and has been tipped for Oscar nominations, but is also stirring controversy for its portrayals of mental illness and violence. It shows the origin story of Batman's nemesis. Time magazine's Stephanie Zacharek said it was guilty of \"aggressive and possibly irresponsible idiocy\", while Variety's reviewer Owen Gleiberman said the film \"does something that flirts with danger - it gives evil a clown-mask makeover, turning it into the sickest possible form of cool\". IndieWire's critic David Ehrlich wrote that there were \"moments of shocking violence\", and that the \"story can't help but feel aspirational\". Phoenix, who plays the title role, left an interview with the Telegraph when he was asked if he was worried that the film might end up inspiring the kind of people it's about, with potentially tragic results. He later returned, explaining that he was thrown because the question hadn't crossed his mind.</p>",
